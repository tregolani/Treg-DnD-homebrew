			<p>Your exposure to the leylines of the Elemental Planes has changed you, granting you the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</li>
				<li>You learn the <i>alter self</i> spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the conjuration or transmutation schools of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can’t cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells’ spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.</li>

			<p>You are an able physician, allowing you to mend wounds quickly and get your allies back in the fight. You gain the following benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Skill Proficiency.</b> You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.</li>

The creature can't regain hit points from this feat again until it finishes a short or long rest.</li>
				<li><b>First Responder.</b> When you use a healer’s kit to stabilize a dying creature, that creature also regains hit points equal to your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier.</li>
				<li><b>Healing Rerolls.</b> Whenever you roll a die to determine the number of hit points you restore with a spell, potion, or any other ability, you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Guts Grip.</b> You may wield a two-handed melee weapon in one hand, treating it as a one-handed weapon. If you do, reduce the damage die by one step. For example, a greatsword or greataxe wielded in one hand deals 1d10 damage.</li>

				<li><b>Versatility.</b> You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with light melee weapons. You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with heavy melee weapons. Increase the range you score a critical hit with a melee weapon that is neither heavy or light by 1.</li>
				<li><b>Weightless Weapons.</b> You can ignore the heavy quality on weapons you wield, or add the light quality to weapons without the heavy quality (no action required). You may wield heavy weapons without penalties if you are Small or smaller.</li>
