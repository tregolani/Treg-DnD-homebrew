		<description>
			<p>A simple silver chain adorned with an intricately carved depiction of a chameleon with a small jade gem inset for its eye.</p>
			<p>While wearing this amulet, you can transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your statistics change. You cannot appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this amulet to become quadrupedal, for instance. The transformation ends if the amulet is removed.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cursed:</em></strong> This item is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a <em>remove curse</em> spell or similar magic. As long as you remain cursed, you cannot discard the amulet, which immediately teleports back into your pocket or pack. This specific curse saps the wearer's strength proportional to the amount of time spend wearing it.</p>
