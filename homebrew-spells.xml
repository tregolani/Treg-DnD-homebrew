    <description>
      <p>You conjure a lance of divine energy and hurl it at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 radiant radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 1d6 necrotic damage (if you are evil), and the lance embeds itself within the creature. The first time it is hit by a weapon attack made by a creature other than yourself before the start of your next turn, the lance detonates, dealing radiant (or necrotic) damage equal to your spellcasting modifier.</p>
      <p class="indent">This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d6 radiant or necrotic damage to the target, and the detonation damage increases to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6/1d4 at 11th level and 17th level.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You create four floating lances of pure ice and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.</p>
      <p class="indent">Make a ranged spell attack for each lance. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 cold damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. A creature can only have its speed reduced once per turn, regardless of how many lances it is hit by.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional lance for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

    <supports>Sorcerer, Wizard, Artificer, Fighter (Eldritch Knight)</supports>
    <description>
      <p>You sheathe yourself in arcane energy, causing six runes, arcing and thrumming with lightning, to appear upon your forearms. When you cast the spell—and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter—you can expend one or two of the runes, each causing a bolt of lightning to blast out from your hand in a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. The first two creatures within the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d4 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each bolt can only affect a maximum of two creatures. Once all of the runes have been expended, the spell ends.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of runes created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

      <p>You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of whirling wind appears there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere, emitting a thunderous boom which can be heard up to 1 mile away. Each creature in the area takes 6d4 thunder damage and must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is knocked prone. Any creature in half or three-quarters cover from the center of the explosion takes half as much damage and does not need to make a Strength saving throw.</p>

		<supports>Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Spell Saving Throw</supports>
		<description>
		<p>A great wave of salt water bursts from the ground beneath your feet. Each creature in a 30-foot cube originating from you must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 15 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed away.</p>
		<p class="indent">Along with the wave, you conjure the spirit of a great shark or other powerful sea creature. Choose one creature that failed its saving throw as the spirit's prey. That target takes an extra 2d10 piercing damage and is restrained by the spirit's jaws or claws for 1 minute. A target restrained in this way can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself and the spirit disappears.</p>
		<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th or higher, the damage of the wave and spirit each increase by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.</p>

		<p class="indent">When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 lightning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>
		<p class="indent">One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 lightning damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall as bolts of lightning leap out towards it. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.</p>

		<description>
			<p>A scintillating cascade of lightning flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 lightning damage and is blinded until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded by this spell. Creatures wearing metal armor or carrying metal weapons have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can create a new blast of lightning as your action on any turn until the spell ends.</p>
			<p class="indent">For the duration, your body crackles violently with the power of a condensed storm. You shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet, and any creature within 15ft of you has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) check to see or listen. In addition, any creature that touches you or hits you with a melee attack takes 2d8 lightning damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.</p>
