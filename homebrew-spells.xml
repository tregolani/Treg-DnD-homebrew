      <p class="indent">This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>

      <p>You channel arcane lightning into the copper sphere, causing six of the runes upon its surface to glow and spark wildly as it begins to float and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell—and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter—you can expend one or two of the sphere's glowing runes, sending a bolt of lightning streaking out from it in a line 100 feet long and 5 feet in a direction you choose. Each creature within the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once you have expended all of the runes, the sphere falls to the ground and the spell ends.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of the sphere's runes you can imbue increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
