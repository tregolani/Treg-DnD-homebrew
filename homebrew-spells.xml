      <p>You charge your fist and launch an arcing bolt of lightning at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage.</p>
      <p class="indent">This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>

      <p>You conjure a lance of divine energy and hurl it at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 radiant radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 1d6 necrotic damage (if you are evil), and the lance embeds itself within the creature. The first time it is hit by a weapon attack made by a creature other than yourself before the start of your next turn, the lance detonates, dealing radiant (or necrotic) damage equal to your spellcasting modifier.</p>
      <p class="indent">This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels. At 5th level, the ranged attack deals an extra 1d6 radiant or necrotic damage to the target, and the detonation damage increases to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d6/1d4 at 11th level and 17th level.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You create four floating lances of pure ice and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.</p>
      <p class="indent">Make a ranged spell attack for each lance. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 cold damage and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. A creature can only have its speed reduced once per turn, regardless of how many lances it is hit by.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional lance for each slot level above 2nd.</p>

    <description>
      <p>You sheathe yourself in arcane energy, causing six runes, arcing and thrumming with lightning, to appear upon your forearms. When you cast the spell—and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafter—you can expend one or two of the runes, each causing a bolt of lightning to blast out from your hand in a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. The first two creatures within the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d4 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each bolt can only affect a maximum of two creatures. Once all of the runes have been expended, the spell ends.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of runes created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

      <p>You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of whirling wind appears there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere, emitting a thunderous boom which can be heard up to 1 mile away. Each creature in the area takes 6d4 thunder damage and must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is knocked prone. Any creature in half or three-quarters cover from the center of the explosion takes half as much damage and does not need to make a Strength saving throw.</p>
      <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 4th.</p>

            <p>You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot shard of jagged ice streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d4 cold damage and another 5d4 cold damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><b><i>At Higher Levels. </i></b>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
