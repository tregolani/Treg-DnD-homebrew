            <p>The power of water is the strength of flexibility, resilience, and a relentless nature. Water parts to allow a ship to sail over it or a diver to plunge into it, but their passing leaves no mark. Water flowing down a mountain reaches the sea. It might bend and turn across valleys and down hillsides, but it slowly and steadily returns to the waves. Those whose souls are touched by the power of elemental water command a similar power.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your heritage ties to powerful creatures of the sea, such as nereids, the lords of the merfolk, and elemental powers. Like a river, you feel the call of the ocean. The call is ever present in your heart, and you are never completely at peace until you are near the sea.</p>

        <description>
          <p>When you choose this origin at 1st level, you learn the secret of infusing your spells with a watery curse.</p>
          <p class="indent">When you hit a creature with a <u>Sorcerer spell</u> attack or when a creature fails a saving throw against your <u>spell</u>, you can curse the target until the end of your next turn or until you curse a different creature with this feature.</p>
          <p class="indent">Once per turn when you hit with a <u>Sorcerer</u> spell, you can trigger the curse if that spell deals cold or lightning damage to the cursed target or forces it to move. Doing so subjects the target to the appropriate additional effect below (you choose the effect to use if more than one effect applies):</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Cold Damage: </b>If the affected target takes cold damage from your spell, the target’s speed is also reduced by 15 feet until the end of your next turn. If the spell already reduces the target’s speed, use whichever reduction is greater.</li>
            <li><b>Lightning Damage: </b>If the affected target takes lightning damage from your spell, the target takes additional lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</li>
            <li><b>Forced Movement: </b>If the target is moved by your spell, increase the distance it is moved by 15 feet. <u>If the target is affected by Tidal Wave or another water- or wind-based spell which doesn't incur forced movement (at the DM's discretion), it is moved 15 feet in the direction of the spell's force.</u></li>

          <p>At 6th level, you gain resistance to fire damage. You also gain the ability to defend yourself by momentarily assuming a watery form. As a reaction when you are hit by an attack and take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from the attack, you can reduce that damage by an amount equal to your sorcerer level plus your Charisma score, and then you can move up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. Once you use this special reaction, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest, <u>unless you spend 4 sorcery points (as a bonus action) to replenish it.</u></p>

          <p>Starting at 14th level, when you move on your turn, you take only half damage from opportunity attacks, and you can move through any enemy's space. <u>If you move through a creature's space, you can use your bonus action to curse the target, as if you had successfully affected it with a spell.</u></p>
		  <p><u>Additionally, if you curse a creature that is Large or smaller, you can spend 1 sorcery point to attempt to grapple it, adding your spell casting proficiency bonus to the check against the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). If you fail the check, you are pushed into a space adjacent to the target and lose any remaining movement.</u></p>
          <p>On your turn, you can move through any space that is at least <u>1 inch</u> in diameter and do so without squeezing.
