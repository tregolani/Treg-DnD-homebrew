Each creature in that area must make a saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) of a type determined by your Draconic Ancestry. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

				<li><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.</li>
				<li><em><strong>Draconic Resistance.</strong></em> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Draconic Ancestry. If you choose poison, you have Advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the @condition[Poisoned] condition on yourself.</li>
				<li><em><strong>Dragonheart.</strong></em> Your creature type is dragon, rather than humanoid.</li>

			<p>The draconic influence which acts upon your essence grows stronger. Choose <b><u>TWO</u></b> of the following traits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><i>Deep Breath.</i></b> As an Action, you can take a deep breath and unleash your Breath Weapon in a more powerful manner. When you do, the damage increases to a number of d10s equal to half your Proficiency Bonus.</li>
				<li><b><i>Dragon Wrath.</i></b> Once per turn when you damage a creature with a weapon attack or spell, you can also deal 1d8 damage of a type associated with your Draconic Ancestry to that creature.</li>
				<li><b><i>Wings.</i></b> You have bat-like wings sprouting from your shoulder blades. You have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed.</li>
				<li><b><i>Visage.</i></b> As a Bonus Action, you change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height between Medium and Small. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though none of your game statistics change. You can't duplicate the appearance of an individual you've never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have.

			<ul>
				<li><b><i>Amphibious.</i></b> You can breathe air and water, and you have a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.</li>
				<li><b><i>Claws.</i></b> Your claws are natural weapons with the Finesse property, which you can use to make unarmed strikes that deal Slashing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier.</li>
				<li><b><i>Desert Predator.</i></b> You gain a Burrow Speed equal to half your Speed. You have Advantage on Saving Throws against effects from wind or sand.</li>
				<li><b><i>Draconic Hide.</i></b> When you aren't wearing armor, your base AC is 13 + Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</li>
				<li><b><i>Draconic Senses.</i></b> You gain proficiency in the Perception skill. If you are already proficient in this skill, you gain Expertise instead.</li>
				<li><b><i>Ice Walk.</i></b> You gain a Burrow Speed equal to half your Speed. You can move around on icy surfaces without making ability checks. Difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost you extra movement.</li>

			<p>Your soul is connected to echoes of draconic might across time and space. You may choose a total of <b><u>TWO</u></b> traits selected from the Half Dragon feat, or from the following traits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><i>Draconic Size.</i></b> You are Large size, and your unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d6 damage of the same type. <i>[Requires a natural weapon, such as a Bite or Claw attack]</i></li>
				<li><b><i>Empowered Breath Weapon.</i></b> If your breath weapon is a cone, it becomes 30 feet. If your breath weapon is a line, it extends to 60 feet. When you use your breath weapon with the Deep Breath trait, double its range. Additionally, you gain a second breath weapon. When you use your Breath Weapon trait, you can replace your breath weapon with an exhalation of energy in a 30-foot cone (60 feet if you use Deep Breath). Whenever you use this trait, choose:</li>
				<ul>
					<li><b><i>Enervating Breath.</i></b> Each creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or become Incapacitated until the start of your next turn.</li>
					<li><b><i>Nightmare Breath.</i></b> Each creature in the area must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or become Frightened until the start of your next turn.</li>
