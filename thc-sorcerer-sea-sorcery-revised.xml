			<p>The power of water is the strength of flexibility, resilience, and a relentless nature. Water parts to allow a ship to sail over it or a diver to plunge into it, but their passing leaves no mark. Water flowing down a mountain reaches the sea. It might bend and turn across valleys and down hillsides, but it slowly and steadily returns to the waves. Those whose souls are touched by the power of elemental water command a similar power.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your heritage ties to powerful creatures of the sea, such as nereids, the lords of the merfolk, and elemental powers. Like a river, you feel the call of the ocean. The call is ever present in your heart, and you are never completely at peace until you are near the sea.</p>

			<p class="indent">Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell you gained from this feature with another spell of the same level. The new spell must be a conjuration or a transmutation spell from the Druid, Sorcerer, or Wizard spell list.</p>

			<p>When you choose this origin at 1st level, you learn the secret of infusing your spells with a watery curse.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you hit a creature with a spell’s attack or when a creature fails a saving throw against your spell, you can curse the target for 1 minute. You can maintain a number of curses on creatures equal to your proficiency bonus. If you curse another creature in excess of this number, you must end the curse on a cursed creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once per turn when you hit with a spell, you can trigger the curse if that spell deals Cold or Lightning damage to a cursed target or forces one to move. Doing so subjects the target to the appropriate additional effect below (you choose the effect to use if more than one effect applies):</p>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Cold Damage: </b>If the affected target takes Cold damage from your spell, the target’s Speed is also reduced by 15 feet until the end of your next turn. If the spell already reduces the target’s Speed, use whichever reduction is greater.</li>
			<li><b>Lightning Damage: </b>If the affected target takes Lightning damage from your spell, the target takes additional Lightning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.</li>
			<li><b>Forced Movement: </b>If the target is moved by your spell, increase the distance it is moved by 15 feet.</li>

You can then move up to 30 feet without provoking Opportunity Attacks, ignoring any ability or condition that reduces your Speed.
